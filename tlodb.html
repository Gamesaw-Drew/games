      <h3>THE LEGEND OF DIAMONDBACK PROGRESS REPORT #1<br><small>By Drew posted June 6, 2017</small></h3>
<p>Welcome to the first progress report for the reboot of Legend of the AMD!<br>
To start this off, I would like to explain why LOTA is being rebooted.<br>
The Unity engine was creating some huge problems that were irreversable. Levels stopped loading properly, with no visible cause. Multiplayer stopped creating players, with no cause. Nothing had changed for it to stop working.<br>
<br><br>
Now I want to talk about the reboot.<br>
The reboot has a different name to give more possibilities for storyline. Legend of the AMD sort of locked the possibilities for the story to be about Chris's computer. 
<br><br>
What's the current progress of the reboot?<br>
Currently, basics of the first and a small amount of the second objectives are implemented<br>
The level loading system<br>
Minimap<br>
Early placeholder for a car<br>
Controls<br>
Controller Support<br>
Multiplayer co-op for story<br>
Zone system<br>
User Interface is very complete in game<br>
Main Menu (Not suitable for controllers yet)<br>
Options (Only has Post Processing options currently)<br>
<br><br>
One of the more recent focuses for TLODB has been making the game fit for controllers. Many people like to use a controller to play PC games, so I am keeping this into consideration when making the game. I want the game to support controllers very well, while not handicapping the keyboard + mouse experience.
